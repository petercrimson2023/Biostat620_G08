# Impact of Social Media Screen Time on Sleep Patterns: A Federated Learning Approach

## Overview
This groundbreaking study delves into the intricate relationship between social media usage and its effects on sleep among college students. Utilizing the innovative federated learning methodology, we aim to uncover patterns and correlations that shed light on how late-night screen time can influence sleep quality and duration. Our investigation navigates through the realms of data science and psychology to offer a comprehensive analysis of this modern-day phenomenon.

## Data Insights
Leveraging data collected from a dedicated cohort of students, we meticulously processed and analyzed variables including social screen time, bedtime habits, ambient temperature, and academic pressures across different semesters. This dataset serves as the backbone of our analysis, providing a unique lens through which we explore the nuances of digital consumption and its implications.

## Methodology
- **Data Preparation**: The journey begins with our `Read_Data.R` script, where raw data is transformed into a clean, analyzable format, ready to reveal its stories.
- **Exploratory Analysis**: Through `EDA_func.R` and `Exploratory_Data_Analysis.Rmd`, we embark on a visual and statistical exploration, unearthing initial insights and patterns that guide our further inquiry.
- **Modeling the Impact**: The essence of our study is captured in `Federated_LR.Rmd` and `model_lm.Rmd`, where we apply federated learning and linear regression models to dissect the relationship between screen time and sleep, pushing the boundaries of traditional data analysis.

## Discoveries and Reflections
Our findings illuminate the complex dynamics between digital engagement and sleep, highlighting significant correlations that beckon further exploration. While the study opens new pathways for understanding, it also humbly acknowledges its limitations, including the scale of data and potential confounding factors. This reflection sets the stage for future investigations to build upon our foundation.
